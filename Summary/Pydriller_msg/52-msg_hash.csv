- Migrate to fragments
- Fix #487
- Don't show ""Open in popup mode"" to channel links
- New backstack of videos
- Change the subscribers count to format using `NumberFormat`, for example some locales use `.`  others `,`, this handles it automatically (and the old method had a bug for leading zero, e.g. 4.82.125 instead of 4.082.125)
- Add string 'subscribers' for channels with more than 1 subscriber (plural)
- Popup player chooses the default format and resolution based on the new preference (format)
- Fix taskaffinity of the router activities
- Show title before loading, as it is available from the items already loaded"

d1b0cd74be873acc2a23b93836c41bbe10cd6a9f,"Added the ability to limit video quality if using mobile data.
* Added a dropdown to video & audio settings
* Changes to ListHelper:
** Limits resolution when code requests the default video resolution
** Limits audio bitrate when code requests the default audio bitrate
** Removed some dead code and did some cleanup
** Make methods private/protected to help understand what was in use
** The code now chooses one format over an other using a simple raking system defined in array constants. I realized I needed to do this in order to choose the most efficient video stream.

-Previous version used emojis for brightness and volume icons, which may
 be inconsistent across devices and do not fit well with other parts of UI
 (Frankly, previous version was more informative than eye-candy)

-This commit replaces old version with circular progress bar that shows
 current value (before conversion). Gesture mode (volume/brightness) is
 indicated by icon that changes between (4/3) modes according to current
 value

-Text information about current value was removed, because with progress
 bar present it does not add any real value to UI."

This is a follow up to TeamNewPipe#2069. I've removed the ""WARNING"" from the second one as it looks a bit silly to have the same thing twice, when the user is already attracted to the first one, which means they will most probably read the second warning.

I can revert this if you don't like it."

Scenario: listening to a video on NewPipe over Bluetooth and a Notification Sound causes audio focus event AUDIOFOCUS_LOSS_TRANSIENT_CAN_DUCK.

Problem: With the current implementation animateAudio would cause the audio to reach the target volume AFTER the notification sound is played, which is irritating and annoying.

Solution: animateAudio should just be used on focusGain where it is sensible to increase audio gradually. On ducking event the reaction should be immediate.

This very simple fix does this. Please approve."

On my local machine (Desktop PC with Java) my tests with a sample size of 10000 calls to the method with param 86400001 showed a performance improvement of about 50%.

See sample code below to reproduce:

    private static final StringBuilder stringBuilder = new StringBuilder();
    private static final Formatter stringFormatter = new Formatter(stringBuilder, Locale.getDefault());
    
    public static String getTimeString(int milliSeconds) {
        int seconds = (milliSeconds % 60000) / 1000;
        int minutes = (milliSeconds % 3600000) / 60000;
        int hours = (milliSeconds % 86400000) / 3600000;
        int days = (milliSeconds % (86400000 * 7)) / 86400000;

        stringBuilder.setLength(0);
        return days > 0 ? stringFormatter.format(""%d:%02d:%02d:%02d"", days, hours, minutes, seconds).toString()
                : hours > 0 ? stringFormatter.format(""%d:%02d:%02d"", hours, minutes, seconds).toString()
                : stringFormatter.format(""%02d:%02d"", minutes, seconds).toString();
    }
    
    public static String getTimeStringL(int milliSeconds) {
        long seconds = (milliSeconds % 60000L) / 1000L;
        long minutes = (milliSeconds % 3600000L) / 60000L;
        long hours = (milliSeconds % 86400000L) / 3600000L;
        long days = (milliSeconds % (86400000L * 7L)) / 86400000L;

        stringBuilder.setLength(0);
        return days > 0 ? stringFormatter.format(""%d:%02d:%02d:%02d"", days, hours, minutes, seconds).toString()
                : hours > 0 ? stringFormatter.format(""%d:%02d:%02d"", hours, minutes, seconds).toString()
                : stringFormatter.format(""%02d:%02d"", minutes, seconds).toString();
    }
    
	public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
		final int SAMPLE_SIZE = 25000;
		long[] results = new long[SAMPLE_SIZE];
		for(int i = 0; i < SAMPLE_SIZE; i++) {
			long now = System.nanoTime();
			getTimeString(86400001);
			results[i] = System.nanoTime() - now;
		}
		long sum = 0;
		for(int i = 0; i < SAMPLE_SIZE; i++) {
			sum += results[i];
		}
		System.out.println(""Average execution time: "" + (sum/SAMPLE_SIZE));
		results = new long[SAMPLE_SIZE];
		for(int i = 0; i < SAMPLE_SIZE; i++) {
			long now = System.nanoTime();
			getTimeStringL(86400001);
			results[i] = System.nanoTime() - now;
		}
		sum = 0;
		for(int i = 0; i < SAMPLE_SIZE; i++) {
			sum += results[i];
		}
		System.out.println(""Average execution time: "" + (sum/SAMPLE_SIZE));"

- wrote more methods to PlayQueue. Now it supports internal history of played items with ability to play previous() item. Also it has equals() to check whether queues has the same content or not
- backstack in fragment is more powerful now with help of PlayQueue's history and able to work great with playlists' PlayQueue and SinglePlayQueue at the same time
- simplified logic inside fragment. Easy to understand. New PlayQueue will be added in backstack from only one place; less number of setInitialData() calls
- BasePlayer now able to check PlayQueue and compare it with currently playing. And if it is the same queue it tries to not init() it twice. It gives possibility to have a great backstack in fragment since the same queue will not be played from two different instances and will not be added to backstack twice  with duplicated history inside
- better support of Player.STATE_IDLE
- worked with layouts of player and made them better and more universal
- service will be stopped when activity finishes by a user decision

- mini player's title, image and author information will be updated in many situations but the main idea is that the info will be the same as currently playing stream. If nothing played then you'll see the info about currently opened stream in fragment. When MainPlayer service stops the info updates too
- made ExpandableSurfaceView to replace AspectRatioFrameLayout. The reason for that is to make possible to use aspect ratio mode ZOOM. It's impossible to show a stream inside AspectRatioFrameLayout with ZOOM mode and to fit the video view to a screen space at the same time. Now the new view able to do that and to show vertical videos in a slightly wide space for them
- refactored some methods to make the code more understandable
- made fixes for player view for landscape-to-landscape orientation change
- added Java docs
- adapted swipe tracking inside bottom sheet
- fixed PlayQueue crashes on clearing

With the extractor PR, fixes title & description shown in the wrong language.
Fixed views / spectators counts possibly in the wrong language
Fixed live spectators not showing full count on detail page
Fixed LIVE shown on players, it shows translated instead

Fixed Videos string in search / three dots not available in Weblate
(because it was videos, but there already was a plural string named videos, in Weblate)

Subscriber count is always giving the short count.
We can't get exact number since this YouTube update: https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/6543166
But only short count (B, M, k), so showing full number, eg for 1.9M: 1,900,000, is wrong because the number could be 1,923,490 or 1,897,789…

Added a « sytem default » option to content language and country language selector.
It's the one selected by default (not en-GB anymore then), and correspond to the
language of the system / country of the system
By system I mean phone, tablet, TV…

Fixed russian showing - before time ago (eg 19hrs ago)
This is a workaround fix, I opened an issue on prettytime library repo.

Fixed russian plurals:
other was used instead of many for videos and subscribers

Fixed seek_duration english only"

When contents of NewPipe navigation drawer change, NavigationMenuView
(which is actually a RecyclerView) removes and re-adds all its adapter
children, which leads to temporary loss of focus on currently focused drawer
child. This situation was not anticipated by developers of original
support library DrawerLayout: while NavigationMenuView itself is able
to keep focus from escaping via onRequestFocusInDescendants(),
the implementation of that method in DrawerLayout does not pass focus
to previously focused View. In fact it does not pass focus correctly at all
because the AOSP implementation of that method does not call addFocusables()
and simply focuses the first available VISIBLE View, without regard
to state of drawers."

Cookie updated whenever ageRestrictedContent setting is changed or

cookies for other services could be added in the future.

Problems with this approach: Even when the service is set to youtube,
the downloader doesn't only request youtube urls e.g. it also sends
reqeusts to i.ytimg.com, suggestqueries.google.com, and yt3.ggpht.com.
The ageRestrictedContent cookie is not normally sent when sending
requests to these other urls, so doing so might have unknown effects."

For all manually-created images PNG have been kept.
- rename all icon attrs to have a `ic_` prefix
- always use `_24dp` icons, because there is no real difference, since they are vector drawables
- always use the original name found on material.io for icon drawables, as to not create confusion and possibly duplicates. Icon names can still be different from real drawable names, though I have made some of them compliant to this or maybe more meaningul.
- remove duplicate `getIconByAttr()` in ThemeHelper (use `resolveResourceIdFromAttr()`
- use standard icons for `expand_more` and `expand_less` instead of triangles
- use `play_button_outline` instead of custom PNG as play button in VideoDetailFragment (questionable, as there is no shadow anymore)"

- each time something starts to play in any player VideoDetailFragment will be started (if not yet started) and mini player will show up. It makes possible to see a playing stream in mini player even if the stream was started without using fragment or after player service was closed somehow
- play/next/queue buttons will be updated in realtime when stream was added/removed from queue instead of waiting for a onPlay/onPause action to happen
- when popup or background players start the stream will start playing only if paused state wasn't requested. Which means, for example, if a user opens popup it will be started when START_PAUSED is false. If, for example, the stream was played in main player and then popup was started the stream will still be playing, but if it was paused it still be paused in popup (or background) in APPEND_ONLY mode (but will be playing on new queue initialization)"

38ed07caa76e9f464a481316621d391fc2c98480,"Downloader: Deleter: Dismiss previous Snackbars

Bug:
In Downloader view, while deleting items, Snackbars at the
bottom of the UI keep queuing up. You need to wait for all
of them to dismiss themselves for files to actually be
deleted. If you close NewPipe before all snackbars are
dismissed, your files will not be deleted and show up again
next time you start NewPipe.

Fix:
When running append(), trigger the commit() action
immediately and cancel all delayed callbacks for commit().

This prevents Snackbars from stacking up in reverse order.

Fixes: https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues/5660"

It seems due to #6394 updating the FragmentX library there was a
change to the order of lifecycle calls, as such onResume() was no longer
before onCreateOptionsMenu() creating a null pointer exception when
using service in onCreateOptionsMenu() as it is only set in onResume().

By moving the initialization of service to onStart() which still happens
before onCreateOptionsMenu() this crash can be avoided. This commit also
adds a check for a null service to prevent future crashes for similar
issues."

05-12 16:38:38.251 24920 26037 E Surface : getSlotFromBufferLocked: unknown buffer: 0x923fc810
05-12 16:38:38.251 24920 26037 W ACodec  : [OMX.qcom.video.decoder.avc] can not return buffer 35 to native window

The problem is that that Exoplayer is trying to write to our -- during rotation -- no longer existant
(VideoDetailFragment) SurfaceView.

Solution:
Implementing SurfaceHolder.Callback and using DummySurface we can now handle the lifecycle of the Surface.

How?: In case we are no longer able to write to the Surface eg. through rotation/putting in
background we can set a DummySurface. Although it only works on API >= 23.
Result: we get a little video interruption (audio is still fine) but we won't get the
'Unrecoverable player error occurred' error message.

This implementation is based on and more background information:
 'ExoPlayer stuck in buffering after re-adding the surface view a few time 2703'

With every 500s there is 6% cpu usage and with 1s only 4%.

80157fc1be921beda9051879dfbe1b9ef95e6075,"Refactor generating InfoItemDialog's

This commit refactors the way `InfoItemDialog`s are generated. This is necessary because the old way used  the `StreamDialogEntry` enum for most of the dialogs' content generation process. This required static variables and methods to store the entries which are used for the dialog to be build (See e.g.`enabledEntries` and methods like `generateCommands()`). In other words, `StreamDialogEntry` wasn't an enumeration anymore.

To address this issue, a `Builder` is introduced for the `InfoItemDialog`'s genration. The builder also comes with some default entries and and a specific order. Both can be used, but are not enforced. 

A second problem that introduced a structure which was atypical for an enumeration was the usage of non-final attributes within `StreamDialogEntry` instances. These were needed, because the default actions needed to overriden in some cases.

To address this problem, the `StreamDialogEntry` enumeration was renamed to `StreamDialogDefaultEntry` and a new `StreamDialogEntry` class is used instead."

210834fbe933654804016e547833288f90e2135e,"Add support of other delivery methods than progressive HTTP (in the player only)

Detailed changes:

- External players:

  - Add a message instruction about stream selection;
  - Add a message when there is no stream available for external players;
  - Return now HLS, DASH and SmoothStreaming URL contents, in addition to progressive HTTP ones.

- Player:

  - Support DASH, HLS and SmoothStreaming streams for videos, whether they are content URLs or the manifests themselves, in addition to progressive HTTP ones;
  - Use a custom HttpDataSource to play YouTube contents, based of ExoPlayer's default one, which allows better spoofing of official clients (custom user-agent and headers (depending of the client used), use of range and rn (set dynamically by the DataSource) parameters);
  - Fetch YouTube progressive contents as DASH streams, like official clients, support fully playback of livestreams which have ended recently and OTF streams;
  - Use ExoPlayer's default retries count for contents on non-fatal errors (instead of Integer.MAX_VALUE for non-live contents and 5 for live contents).

- Download dialog:

  - Add message about support of progressive HTTP streams only for downloading;
  - Remove several duplicated code and update relevant usages;
  - Support downloading of contents with an unknown media format.

- ListHelper:

  - Catch NumberFormatException when trying to compare two video streams between them.

- Tests:

  - Update ListHelperTest and StreamItemAdapterTest to fix breaking changes in the extractor.

- Other places:

  - Fixes deprecation of changes made in the extractor;
  - Improve some code related to the files changed.

- Issues fixed and/or improved with the changes:

  - Seeking of PeerTube HLS streams (the duration shown was the one from the stream duration and not the one parsed, incomplete because HLS streams are fragmented MP4s with multiple sidx boxes, for which seeking is not supported by ExoPlayer) (the app now uses the HLS manifest returned for each quality, in the master playlist (not fetched and computed by the extractor));
  - Crash when loading PeerTube streams with a separated audio;
  - Lack of some streams on some YouTube videos (OTF streams);
  - Loading times of YouTube streams, after a quality change or a playback start;
  - View count of YouTube ended livestreams interpreted as watching count (this type of streams is not interpreted anymore as livestreams);
  - Watchable time of YouTube ended livestreams;
  - Playback of SoundCloud HLS-only tracks (which cannot be downloaded anymore because the workaround which was used is being removed by SoundCloud, so it has been removed from the extractor)."

e3c2aea3cc3abaaa86c36b0f8e8c6b6660a33795,"Fix playback of non-URI HLS streams

A custom HlsPlaylistParserFactory cannot be used anymore to play HLS streams.

This needs to be replaced by a custom HlsDataSourceFactory, which returns a ByteArrayDataSource (where the bytes of this DataSource correspond to the bytes of the playlist string) and a specified DataSource for other request types.

This model has two limitations:

- if media requests are relative, the URI from which the manifest comes from (either the manifest URI (preferred) or the master URI (if applicable)) must be returned, otherwise the content will be not playable, as it will be an invalid URL, or it may be treat as something unexpected, for instance as a file for DefaultDataSources;
- if the playlist is a master playlist, endless loops should be encountered because the DataSources created for media playlists will use the master playlist response instead of fetching the corresponding playlist. With the current model of HlsDataSourceFactory, there is no possibility to distinguish the playlist type or the URI that is requested.

If ExoPlayer provides a way to create HlsMediaSources with an HlsPlaylist in the future, it should be used instead of this solution."

- a class to avoid code duplication in CommentTextOnTouchListener, TouchUtils;

Media tunneling may be not supported by more devices than the ones we
whitelisted before.

As a matter of fact, the list of devices on which media tunneling is disabled
could be not maintainable in the future, especially if the list of devices
grows more and more.

A preferable solution is to allow users to configure this setting themselves,
allowing them to not wait for their device(s) to be whitelisted in a future
NewPipe update.

This solution has been applied in this commit and works on every build type.

The corresponding preference in the debug settings has been of course removed
and the code used to prevent media tunneling activation on specific devices has
been removed."

787758a4360063cafce3f77d8cf562082419945f,"[Android 6+] Add ability to always use ExoPlayer's MediaVideoCodecRenderer setOutputSurface workaround

As some devices not present in ExoPlayer's list may not implement
MediaCodec.setOutputSurface(Surface) properly, this workaround could be useful
on these devices.

It forces ExoPlayer to fall back on releasing and re-instantiating video codec
instances, which is always used on Android 5 and lower due to addition of this
method in Android 6.

To do so, a CustomMediaCodecVideoRenderer, based on ExoPlayer's
MediaVideoCodecRenderer which always return true for the
codecNeedsSetOutputSurfaceWorkaround method has been added, which is used in
CustomRenderersFactory, a class based on DefaultRenderersFactory which always
returns our CustomMediaCodecVideoRenderer as the video renderers.

CustomRenderersFactory replaces DefaultRenderersFactory in the player, in the
case this setting is enabled."

- fix checkstyle errors
- tests do not run in order, so each one has to do its own assertions separately from what others did
- the uid of an entity in the database needn't be the same of the one created in-memory, since the uid gets assigned upon inserting in the database
- some database functions return a `Completable` that doesn't do anything until it is subscribed to or awaited, so I added `.awaitBlocking()` where needed
- the data of an entity in-memory does not get updated automatically when the corresponding entity in the database is changed, so some tests have been removed
- `manager.insertSubscription` only inserts recent streams, so they need to have a date set on them (I also made related items hardcoded and not dependent on what the channel is currently doing)"

8d59812827a3993fcdd3d322100e7f053bcca96b,"Fix channel avatar not loading correctly sometimes

The fix just involves removing some really outdated code (6 years ago) added in https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/commit/33e29be7db2e4a6fcd23e411081c871bf3c4b5c3#diff-38bd2cf1b92659b499c08e1cf6ac9ef384c7e13381b906f2f98c57cbb758756dR778 (blame: https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/blame/9318bb530619898c1e1f3f8a8c866f3d2e35ab0c/app/src/main/java/org/schabi/newpipe/detail/VideoItemDetailActivity.java#L778).
What that code did was setting the 'buddy' image to the uploader avatar as a placeholder, and then setting the actual image if it existed and after it had loaded.
That code remained there up until now, but now it doesn't make sense anymore, since Picasso already takes care of setting placeholders.
The problem is, starting from #10066 the actual uploader image is set before (not after) those lines of code, making them do the wrong thing, i.e. always overwrite the currently set image.
But then why did the channel avatar image work normally sometimes?
My guess is that since Picasso loads images in the background, when opening a video from scratch setting the placeholder still happened before Picasso finished loading the image.
However when the image is already cached it's loaded much faster and therefore setting the placeholder happens after, effectively hiding the loaded image."

Reduced memory footprint of FeedUpdateInfo objects. Those objects might stay around for a while and accumulate (up to BUFFER_COUNT_BEFORE_INSERT = 20 at the moment), so in order not to fill up the memory it's better to keep as little data as possible.
Previously ChannelInfo data was stored, causing ReadyChannelTabLinkHandler objects to be also stored uselessly (and those channel tabs contain prefetched JSON data which used ~700KB of memory)."
